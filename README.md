# appRnTemplate
A react-native farm control app template with a side menu and two types of SVG dashboard gauges: line scale gauge and circle scale time gauge.

Side menu is implemented with [wix react-native-navigation v2](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/tree/v2), screenshots:

Dashboard gauges are implemented with [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg). 

Line scale gauge shows a sensor value and its limits. Current sensor value is displyed as a text and as a mark on the scale. The sensor value color corresponds to the color of the mark location on the scale.

Circle scale time gauge is to show (farm) running time over a day period.
